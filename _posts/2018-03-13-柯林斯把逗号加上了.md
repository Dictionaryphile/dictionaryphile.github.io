现在去看 https://www.collinsdictionary.com/api ，逗号已经加上了。        
        
果然是 world-class 啊，不像国内一些著名词典站点，六七年前我反馈的问题，今天都还在。        
        
顺便，仔细看一下邮件，会发现我的一个小问题，missed 应该为 missing 或者 missed out，当然，要抬杠的话，missed 也说得通。        
        
哎，心累。

>**missing / missed (adjs) = lost / cannot be found**        
◈        
When **missing** and **missed** are used as adjectives, they behave like present and past participles, e.g **missing pages** are pages that are **missing**, a **missed opportunity** is an opportunity that has been **missed**. Note also that **missing** is often placed after the noun it qualifies, rather than in front of it. Compare the following:        
◈        
- The weather cleared. We should have climbed the mountain. It was **a missed opportunity**.        
- They were unable to complete the jigsaw as **several pieces were missing**.        
- Did you know there are **five pages missing** from this book? It goes from 32 to 43.        
- My name was missing from the list of participants but it was clear that I had enrolled.        
- Ten people are known to have died in the blast and a further **fifteen are still missing**.        
- Did you know you've got **a button missing** from your blue shirt?        
- She has been missing for over six months and has now been placed on **the missing persons register**.        
◈        
Note that in this last example we talk about **a missing person** or **a missing persons register**, rather than missing people or a missing peoples register, to emphasize the individuality of people who have left home and it is not known whether they are alive or dead.
