# 每逢佳节胖三斤英语怎么说？

一个学术问题。

“每逢佳节胖三斤”，我给个英译：Whenever there is a festival, there is weight gain.

搜了些句子：
- What Science Says about Holiday Weight Gain
- Avoid vacation weight gain: 5 tips
- How to Avoid Holiday Weight Gain
- 20 Ways to Beat Post-Holiday Weight Gain - Reader's Digest
- Holiday Eating Tips Guaranteed to Help You Avoid Weight Gain
- ……

想来这是世界范围内的难题。

###### 柯林斯 COBUILD 高阶英汉双解学习词典
>**resolution**
» They made a resolution to lose all the weight gained during the Christmas period. 他们下定决心要减去圣诞期间增加的体重。
**taut** /tɔːt/
» That summer she had shed the weight gained during pregnancy, her body was trim and taut. 那年夏天，她减去了怀孕期间增加的体重，身材又变得修长而健美。

注：taut 和 taught 发音相同，均为 /tɔːt/ 。

###### 新世纪英汉大词典
>**torte** /tɔːt/
*n*
【烹】 （源自奥地利的）果子奶油蛋糕
**taut**
(firm) [+ body, person] 肌肉结实的；健美的
» That summer she had shed the weight gained during pregnancy, her body was trim and taut. 那年夏天她减掉了怀孕时增加的体重, 身体苗条结实了。

记个句子吧：The torte taught me how to be taut 才怪.

###### 剑桥高阶英汉双解词典
>**vicious circle**
a continuing unpleasant situation, created when one problem causes another problem which then makes the first problem worse 恶性循环
» Many people get caught/trapped in a vicious circle of dieting and weight gain. 很多人都陷入节食减肥而后又体重增加的恶性循环之中。
