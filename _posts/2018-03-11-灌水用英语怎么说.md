有问题，先查词典，看看前人怎么看的，这并不丢人，不懂装懂才丢人。原创太难了，（能）人这么多，我们能想到的，不太可能没人想过；我们遇到的问题，前人很可能已经遇到过且给出了解决方案。          
        
有同学肯定觉得，你水平那么高，应该不用查词典才对。非也非也，知识越多，查词典越多，兼听则明。          
        
我天天有空就查 take 、go、run 、do 这些词呢。          
        
以上是“灌水”示例，那么“灌水”英语怎么讲呢？

###### Forum spam - Wikipedia          
>**Forum spam** consists of posts on Internet forums that contains related or unrelated advertisements, links to malicious websites, trolling and abusive or otherwise unwanted information. Forum spam is usually posted onto message boards by automated spambots or manually with unscrupulous intentions with one idea in mind: to get the spam in front of readers who would not otherwise have anything to do with it intentionally.          
        
###### http://www.mediacollege.com/home/faq/banned.html          
>Forum-spam works in a similar way to email spam, except that the spammers post messages in forums.          
In the good old days, forum spammers were mostly automated so email validation and CAPTCHA security kept most of them out. These days the spammers employ real people to manually post spam messages. No amount of automated tests can stop them because they are just as real as genuine members.          
Forum spam is often quite sophisticated.
