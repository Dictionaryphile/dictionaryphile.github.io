###### 柯林斯 COBUILD 高阶英汉双解学习词典（第 8 版）  
>**former**  
» ...the former Soviet Union. 先前的苏联  
» ...the former Yugoslavia. 原来的南斯拉夫  
**buffer state**  
» Turkey and Greece were buffer states against the former Soviet Union. 土耳其和希腊曾经是苏联与反苏国家之间的缓冲国。  
**cosmonaut**

所以，《柯林斯 COBUILD 高阶英汉双解学习词典》（第 8 版）应该是刻意地放弃了“前苏联”这个词组，估计有其原因，但是《新世纪英汉大词典》并没有这样做。
