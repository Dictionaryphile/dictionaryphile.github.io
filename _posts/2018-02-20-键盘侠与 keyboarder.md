###### 朗文当代高级英语辞典（英英·英汉双解）（第 5 版）  
>**key‧board‧er** /'kiː,bɔːdə ˋki͵bɔrdɚ/  
someone whose job is to put information into a computer, using a keyboard 键盘输入员，键盘操作员  
→ **typist**  
**typ‧ist**  /'taɪpɪst 'taɪpəst ˋtaɪpɪst/    
*n  C*  
**1** a secretary whose main job is to TYPE letters 打字员  
**2** someone who uses a computer KEYBOARD or a TYPEWRITER 打字者  
» I’m a slow typist. 我打字很慢。  

这个词让我联想到“键盘侠”，当然，keyboarder 其实是 typist 的同义词，和汉语里的“键盘侠”没什么联系。不过英语词典中确实已经有类似词汇了，OALD、ODE 在线版都已经收录。
